# Ridiculous Show Finder

Lets you search for shows(the app is ridiculous not the shows) but I did it using react hooks which is not ridiculous at all

# All Hooks

Wanted to build it all with hooks just because. It feels so much cleaner and personally i feel like you get better performance considering classes are not really classes in javascript

# Api

I am using the Tv Maze api which is pretty simple and gets you quite a bit of data with little effort

# Minimal & Smart UI

The best apps use very little ui that are intuitive I share that same goal. I will use each page as a way to focus on one action with very little to get in the way of that one thing.
